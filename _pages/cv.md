Education
======
* M.S in Data Science, University of Texas at Austin, December 2024 (expected)
* M.Eng in Mechanical Engineering, Cornell University, 2021
* B.S in Mechanical Engineering, Cornell University, 2021

Work Experience
======
Sikorsky Aircraft, Lockheed Martin, Structural Analyst: January 2021 - August 2023
* Primary role was to evaluate the structural integrity of systems using hand calculations and finite element analysis to inform design iterations and meet design requirements. 

*Project 1: Test Data Review Automation*
* Developed Python code to automate review of physical test data and flag potential measurement issues, leading to the detection of hundreds of previously missed irregularities. 

*Project 2: Sizing Update Automation*
* Developed a Python program to standardize and automate the process of updating sizing information in a simulated aircraft model, with a focus on checking user inputs and writing test cases.
* Estimated to save 1600 hours of manual processes over several design phases.

*Project 3: Helicopter Maneuver Classification*
* Classified groups of helicopter maneuvers based on operational, multi-dimensional time series data through the 18-week Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Fundamentals program. 
* Conducted initial pre-processing steps including extracting data from thousands of text files, grouping maneuvers based on names, and performing data imputations. 
* Achieved a 30% absolute increase in classification accuracy over random selection by generating and selecting features to the flatten the time series data, applying and tuning a random forest classifier. 

Project Experience
======
Spotify Project: Dec. 2024 â€“ Feb. 2024
* Utilized Spotify API to retrieve podcast episode descriptions and audio features for over 1000 songs.
* Used ChatGPT API to summarize the lyrics of the song and Sentence BERT Transformer to recommend songs based on the podcast episode descriptions. 
* Implemented a Gaussian Mixture Model to cluster songs based on their audio features, feeding the results into classification trees to gain interpretability insights from the data.  

Distracted Driver Monitor Project, Embedded System Design (ECE 5725): Fall 2021                                                 
* Created and deployed an application on a Raspberry Pi that receives streaming Pi camera footage along with real-time vehicle speed data to monitor and alert drivers when they are distracted with the car in motion. 
* Used OpenCV and DLib to detect a face and extract facial features and determine whether the driver is drowsy, facing away, or looking away from the road. 
* Accessed real-time vehicle speed from OBDII scanner to inform the onboard system whether to sound an alarm
