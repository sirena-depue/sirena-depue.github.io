Hello! I am currently taking the one class remaining to complete my master’s degree in data science at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://cdso.utexas.edu/msds) in December 2024. Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor’s and Master of Engineering degrees in mechanical engineering from Cornell University in 2021.

Following my graduation, I joined Sikorsky Aircraft as a structural analyst. While my primary role was evaluating structural design, I became increasingly involved in automation and data science projects. Notably, I completed the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Fundamentals program offered by Lockheed Martin. My project aimed to classify groups of helicopter maneuvers based on operational, multi-dimensional time series data. I was also solely responsible for automating the process of updating section properties within a global helicopter model, which is projected to save 1600 hours of manual processes across several design phases.

During the summer of 2024, I joined SoftInWay as a data science intern, where I implemented a transformer model to predict variable-length sequential data based on user input data.  I also used gaussian process modeling to predict whether turbine input parameters would result in physically realistic designs. This approach reduced the need for extensive and costly failure data. Additionally, I implemented Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) for efficient nearest neighbor search, suggesting alternative input parameters for unrealistic designs based on their proximity to known successful designs. 

With only one class remaining, I am now actively seeking full time job opportunities in the data science field. For further details on my experience and to explore other relevant projects, please refer to my CV and blog posts.
