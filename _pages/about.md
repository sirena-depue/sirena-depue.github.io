Hello! I am currently pursuing a [Masterâ€™s in Data Science](https://cdso.utexas.edu/msds) at The University of Texas at Austin, with an expected completion in December 2024. Prior to this, I obtained my B.S. and M.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering from Cornell University in 2021. Before starting my Masters at UT Austin, I worked as a structural engineer at Sikorsky Aircraft. While my primary role was evaluating and improving structural design, I became increasingly involved in automation and data science projects. Notably, I completed the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Fundamentals program offered by Lockheed Martin. My project aimed to classify groups of helicopter maneuvers based on operational, multi-dimensional time series data. I was also solely responsible for automating the process of updating section properties within a global helicopter model, which is projected to save 1600 hours of manual processes across several design phases.

With only one class remaining, I am now actively seeking full time job opportunities in the data science field. For further details on my experience and to explore other relevant projects, please refer to my CV and blog post.
