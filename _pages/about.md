Hello! I am currently pursuing a [Masterâ€™s in Data Science](https://cdso.utexas.edu/msds) at The University of Texas at Austin, with an expected completion in Fall 2024. Prior to this, I obtained my B.S. and M.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering from Cornell University in 2021. Before starting my Masters at UT Austin, I worked as a structural engineer at Sikorsky Aircraft. While my primary role was evaluating and improving structural design, I became increasingly involved in automation and data science projects. Notably, I completed the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Fundamentals program offered by Lockheed Martin. My project aimed to classify groups of helicopter maneuvers based on operational, multi-dimensional time series data. I was also solely responsible for automating the process of updating section properties within a global helicopter model, which is projected to save 1600 hours of manual processes across several design phases.

With 70% of my coursework to be completed by the end of spring 2024, I am now actively seeking job opportunities in the data science and machine learning field. Given the program's inherent flexibility, I am prepared to transition into full-time employment during the summer of 2024. For further details on my experience and to explore other relevant projects, please refer to my CV and blog posts.
